1. What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier? 

I could have spent more time making a step-by-step plan. This would have helped me avoid confusion and work faster. I also should have checked if I had all the tools I needed before starting.

2. Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects? 
Some parts of the code were hard to write, like handling input validation. If I practiced those skills more or used examples from similar projects, it might have been easier.

3. What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time? I would add extra features like categories for the tasks. I would also spend more time improving the design to make it look nicer and easier to use.

4. Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again. Always test small pieces of code before adding them to the project. It's easier to find problems that way. Also, don’t rush—take time to plan and review each step.
